# Toolbox

This repo contains miscellaneous small CLI tools. It forms part of my larger macOS setup which consists of:

- **[dawn](https://github.com/stringlytyped/dawn)**: a script that walks you through the process of setting up a newly-installed copy of macOS from scratch
- **toolbox** (this repo): miscellaneous shell scripts that perform various functions (some of questionable utility)
- **[dotfiles](https://github.com/stringlytyped/dotfiles)**: shell preferences, including useful aliases for common tasks

## Prerequisites

You will need to install the following dependencies:

- GNU Coreutils
- wget
- [wiki](https://github.com/walle/wiki)

## Tools

### voeltjie

This is a silly bash script that fetches a random bird from the Afrikaans version of Wikipedia and displays its name, a short description and a link its Wikipedia article. To use, just run `./voeltjie`. It doesn't take any arguments.
